# What is the game all about ? 

The objective is to be able to match all cards contained in the deck by pairs with a minimum number of moves. 

## How to play ? 

 You just have to click on **two cards** to flip them and see the symbols they contain. If the two symbols match, you are on a good way to success ! You'll just have to pursue until all the cards contained in the deck are matched by pairs. 

## How do I know my score and time ? 

There is a timer that is displayed on the page, and that shows the time elapsed since the very first card you clicked on. 
At the end of the game, a pop up will let you know your score, your final time, and invite you to play again. 
Also, you can have an idea of wheter you has a great score or not by looking at the number of **stars** displayed on the page and the pop up. 3 is the maximum, and one the minimum.
